Adds support for Gzipped rss feeds.

== Description ==

Wordpress has no gzip support for fetching gzipped html pages. 
Some rss feeds are only offerd in gzip format. That.s why i 
patched the existing class-snoopy.php to add gzip support.

== Installation ==

To install just copy the file in the zip over the original one in your Wordpress install folder in subdir /wp-includes
